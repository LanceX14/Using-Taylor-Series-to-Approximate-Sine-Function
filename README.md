# Using-Taylor-Series-to-Approximate-Sine-Function
## Introduction: 
Taylor series are excellent polynomial-based approximations to complex functions. This is accomplished by substituting polynomials with the same derivatives as the original function for the actual function.
The accuracy of the representation increases as the number of derivatives that a polynomial has in common with a specific function grows. The approximation of a sine function is a common application of a Taylor series. As shown in the equation below, it is represented by a sum of terms.((source: https://dotancohen.com/eng/taylor-sine.php))

## How to Use the Project:
Users can see the graph of the sine function predicted by the Taylor series by entering the desired angle range and the number of terms of derivatives. They can compare with the standard sine function graph(trace 0) by adding multiple predicted function graphs and understand how the Taylor series does it by increasing the number of derivative to get closer to the sine function.
